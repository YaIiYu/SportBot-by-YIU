Just enter your calories + macros into ChatGPT, and it can help create a meal plan using your favorite foods!\n\nStep 3: The Secret to Transformation\nAs you can see, this isn’t a diet – no calorie deficit needed! Simply adjusting the right proportion of protein, carbs, and fats will naturally reshape your body. 💥\nWith the workouts, you’ll automatically create a small caloric deficit, which your body will cover by burning fat. That’s how you’ll get stronger, leaner, and more defined! 🔥\n\nStep 4: Make It Sustainable\nI won’t give you a strict meal plan because we all have different habits and preferences. Instead, I’ll show you what I eat, and you’ll create your own plan with foods you actually enjoy—because if you don’t like it, you won’t stick to it!",
